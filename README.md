<h2 align='left'> Twitter Sentiment - King of Pop </h2>
<h3 align='left'> Developed by Wenyi Hu </h3>

The 'King of Pop' tweets were collected from twitter by running a scraping script on an EC2 instance and ingested into AWS S3 bucket via kinesis firehose. Then the collected tweets were read from S3 into Databricks by mounting the bucket. The sentiment scores were generated by Textblob and a sentiment analysis model with multiple transformers in the pipeline was developed to predict the sentiment scores using Spark ML. The prediction was saved back to S3 for creating a dashboard which generats the insights of tweets and sentiment by using Athena to create dataset tables and Quicksight to build a dashboard.
